# API Assistant

## Manage backend from your frontend

API Assistant is a platform that helps developers to concentrate in the architecture and the implementation of frontend components and painting the API results, instead of writing server side code to connect with database and transfer the data through APIs

It stores all your application data in a seperate MongoDB. So you can do all the standard *CRUD* operations without managing application and database servers.

> Currently supports 9 MongoDB operations _insertOne, insertMany, findOne, find, updateOne, updateMany, deleteOne, deleteMany, aggregate_

## How it works ?
1. Construct MongoDB queries in the frontend, specify the action like _insertOne_ or _findOne_ and collection name in the request, pass it to API Assistant global API and paint the UI with API response.

2. Integrate tailored Authentication APIs in your frontend application that provides a standard signup and login functionalities

3. API Assistant also provides storage API. Use it to upload file objects and specify the file path in request body

4. Access all your database and storage data in API Assistant Simple and Smooth UI
